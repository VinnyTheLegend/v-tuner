Enable handling UI with `/v-tuner`
`/v-tuner car <vehicle model>` - spawn vehicle (requires permission)
`/v-tuner reset` - reset vehicle base handling to the handling.meta file

add citizen IDs to `DEVS` in sv-stuff to give permission only to this resource and its commands (this includes spawning vehicles!)
