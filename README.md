Enable handling UI with `/v-tuner`
`/v-tuner car <vehicle model>` - spawn vehicle (requires permission)
`/v-tuner reset` - reset vehicle base handling to the handling.meta file

Add citizen IDs to `DEVS` in sv-stuff to give permission only to this resource and its commands (this includes spawning vehicles!)


Change "Current Handling" values to modify the handling of the currently spawned instance of the vehicle.

Change "Base Handling" values to modify the database which will be loaded on all instances of the vehicle (updated upon entering a vehicle).
